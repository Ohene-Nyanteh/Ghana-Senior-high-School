      <p>
        Ghana Senior High School, Koforidua, popularly known as GHANASS, is a
        high school in Koforidua. It was preceded by the establishment of two
        colleges that ultimately combined into what is currently known as The
        Beacon of the East History In 1943, Fred Addae and Francis Adjei Tetebo
        established a school with 16 boys called Phoenix College in a temporary
        building. By 1950, an increase in students necessitated a new location
        which today houses the Normal Technical Institute, Koforidua. The change
        in location brought in its wake a change in the school's name from
        Phoenix College to Christ College. The location of the premises had to
        change again after some time to respond to the increasing student
        population. Thus, the school moved into Effiduase where it was housed at
        the current premises of Effiduase Police Quarters in Koforidua, Ghana.
        This was made possible by the efforts of Rev. Dr. Nimako, the first MP
        for New Juaben Constituency, Mr WT Wutor, a contractor and Nana Frempong
        Mposo II, the then chief of Effiduase. During this period, Mr. Francis
        Adjei Tetebo was the Principal of the college. Mr Fred Addae the
        headmaster had then died. Later developments In 1957, the year that
        Ghana gained independence, Osagyefo Dr. Kwame Nkrumah on a visit to
        Koforidua requested a name change of the school from Christ College to
        Ghana Secondary School. The change was so that the new name could be in
        line with other government established secondary schools such as the
        Ghana National College in Cape Coast and the Ghana Secondary Technical
        School in Takoradi. When the school was absorbed into the public school
        system, Mr. Daniel Ofori Dankwa who was then a Science teacher at Accra
        Academy was encouraged to come and steer the affairs of the
        establishment. In that same year, the first Speech and Prize - Giving
        Day was organized. The school then had a population of 100 boys and 6
        girls with a staff of only 6. By dint of hardwork, Mr D. Ofori Dankwa
        continued to develop the school until 1974 when he was promoted to
        Director of Education. He was succeeded by Rev. R. P. Nyarko. The school
        now has a population of over two thousand three hundred students (males
        and females) with a staff population of about eighty well qualified and
        trained teachers. Headteachers
